            <h2>üß© What is Windhawk?</h2>
            <p>Windhawk is an innovative Windows modding framework designed to provide unparalleled customization capabilities. Unlike traditional methods that often involve risky system file modifications, Windhawk operates by injecting small, independent "mods" (short for modifications) into memory. This approach ensures that your system files remain untouched, making all changes live, reversible, and non-destructive.</p>
            <p>Developed by Ramon Unch, renowned for the highly successful 7+ Taskbar Tweaker, Windhawk builds upon a foundation of deep Windows understanding and a commitment to user-friendly customization.</p>

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How It Works</h2>
            <p>Getting started with Windhawk is straightforward, and its underlying mechanism prioritizes safety and flexibility.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Download & Install Windhawk:</strong>
                    <p>Obtain the official Windhawk application directly from its trusted source:</p>
                    <p><a href="https://windhawk.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://windhawk.net</a></p>
                    <p>The installation process is quick and simple, integrating Windhawk seamlessly into your system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Browse & Install Mods:</strong>
                    <p>Windhawk features an intuitive internal mod browser. Once installed, you can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Search for a wide variety of community-made mods catering to different customization needs.</li>
                        <li>View the source code and detailed descriptions of each mod, ensuring transparency.</li>
                        <li>Install or uninstall mods with a single click directly from the application.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Load Mods into Memory:</strong>
                    <p>This is where Windhawk's non-destructive nature shines. Mods are injected live into the target process (e.g., <code>explorer.exe</code>). There's no need for system reboots or permanent file changes. You can enable or disable mods on the fly, and they will take effect immediately. Mods are designed to load automatically when their target process starts, ensuring your customizations are active upon login.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Write Your Own Mods (Optional, for Developers):</strong>
                    <p>For users comfortable with programming, particularly C++, Windhawk offers a robust Software Development Kit (SDK). This allows you to write your own custom mods, providing hooks and APIs to safely inject code into Windows processes. This opens up endless possibilities for tailored customizations.</p>

            <h2>üõë Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
            <p>While Windhawk is designed with safety in mind, it's important to be aware of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mod Power:</strong> Windhawk mods are powerful tools that can deeply interact with Windows processes. Always use trusted mods and, if possible, review the source code before installation to understand their functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Potential for Issues:</strong> Although Windhawk doesn't permanently modify Windows files, poorly written or incompatible mods can potentially cause temporary bugs, unexpected behavior, or even application crashes. If an issue arises, disabling or uninstalling the problematic mod usually resolves it immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Windows Update Compatibility:</strong> Major Windows Updates can sometimes introduce changes to internal system structures that a mod targets. This might break the compatibility of certain mods, especially those that interact closely with <code>explorer.exe</code> internals. The Windhawk community and developers usually work quickly to update affected mods.</li>
                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Windhawk is most beneficial for power users, enthusiasts, and developers who are comfortable with the concept of system modding and are looking for advanced customization options beyond standard Windows settings.</li>
            </ul>
